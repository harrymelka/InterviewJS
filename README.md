# Interview My Pearl Javascript

## Problem Description

Your goal is to create an interface that display all the users and the possibility to enter in the profil of each user and display informations that you think could be releveant with style.

### To build the project
Open a terminal
### `git clone https://github.com/harrymelka/InterviewJS.git`
### `cd InterviewJS`
### `npm install && npm start`

open chrome and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## A bit of information

You are going to get all the information from Firestore database in Firebase from the Users collection (https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).

There is so many users and it would be great if we could have something to help us find one or filter them according to a criteria.

You can use whatever you think can be useful for this project (hooks, redux, tailwind, navigation, funny stuff, none of it, ...).

You don't need to spend too much time on this test, our goal is to evaluate your choices and what you can produce. You will be interviewed by one of our engineer to explain your code

Note that style matter, you are not a designer but we are not blind - Undefined Undefined

# Happy Coding
